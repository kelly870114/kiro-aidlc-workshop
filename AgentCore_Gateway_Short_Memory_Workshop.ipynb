    "# AgentCore Memory Workshop: Building Strands Agents with Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the AgentCore Memory Workshop! This notebook focuses on building intelligent agents with memory capabilities using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory and Strands framework. You'll learn how to create agents that remember conversations and provide personalized experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand** AgentCore Memory architecture and concepts\n",
    "- **Create** memory resources for short-term conversation storage\n",
    "- **Implement** memory hooks for automatic conversation management\n",
    "- **Build** agents that remember user preferences and context\n",
    "- **Test** memory functionality with practical examples\n",
    "- **Apply** best practices for memory management in production\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This workshop assumes you have completed the AgentCore Runtime Workshop first.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop reuses resources created in the Runtime Workshop to avoid duplication:\n",
    "- ✅ **IAM Role**: `AgentCoreWorkshopRole` (will be updated with Memory permissions)\n",
    "- ✅ **Cognito User Pool**: Authentication configuration\n",
    "- ✅ **AgentCore Gateway**: Existing gateway with OpenAPI targets\n",
    "- ✅ **API Credentials**: OpenWeather API key configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't completed the Runtime Workshop, some steps may fail. You should either:\n",
    "1. **Recommended**: Complete the Runtime Workshop first\n",
    "2. **Alternative**: Manually create the missing resources when prompted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Knowledge Requirements\n",
    "- Strands framework fundamentals\n",
    "- Building agents with tools and external APIs\n",
    "- AWS services and IAM configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### AgentCore Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory is a managed service that provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Short-term memory** for conversation continuity\n",
    "- **Long-term memory** with intelligent summarization\n",
    "- **Automatic management** of memory lifecycle\n",
    "- **Scalable storage** for multiple users and sessions\n",
    "- **Integration** with Strands agents through hooks"
